## Hands-on: Gemini 3 Pro on Google Cloud Vertex AI

Completed a hands-on lab as part of the Google Cloud Tech Series 2026.

### What I explored
- Thinking levels (Minimal, Low, High) to manage reasoning depth, latency, and cost
- Multi-turn conversational context handling
- Multimodal inputs including text, PDFs, and audio
- Enterprise AI usage via APIs instead of training models from scratch

### Key takeaway
This lab helped me understand how modern AI systems are configured and orchestrated in real-world products, moving beyond purely theoretical learning.

Focus:Practical AI platforms & business use cases
